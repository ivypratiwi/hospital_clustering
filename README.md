# Hospital Clustering

This project aims to perform clustering analysis for over six thousand hospitals in USA. The result from this project will show the utilisation rate for different categories of hospitals by performing K-means and K-prototypes clustering. 

The distribution of the clusters are visualised using the distribution plot and pairplot.


# Some of the Libraries used in this project:
   - Sklearn K-Means
   - Sklearn K-Prototypes
   - SKlearn preprocessing
   - Numpy
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn


# Local Setup
Jupyter notebook is required to run the code.

If the Jupyter notebook is in the local computer, copy this folder to your jupyter notebook path. Then, open the `HospitalClustering.ipynb` file in your local jupyter notebook. Run the code in the jupyter notebook.
